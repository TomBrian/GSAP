## GSAP (Greensock Animation Platform) Animations Portfolio (Vanilla JS, HTML & Tailwind CSS)

This repository showcases my skills in creating web animations using GSAP, a powerful JavaScript animation library, along with Tailwind CSS for clean and efficient styling.

### Animation Categories

This collection is organized into folders to demonstrate my ability to animate various elements:

- **Text:** Animations that manipulate text content and appearance.
- **UI:** Animations applied to user interface elements like buttons and menus.
- **SVG:** Animations that bring Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) to life.
- **Scroll:** Animations triggered by user scrolling behavior.
- **Core:** (Optional) Foundational GSAP code and utility functions.

Explore the code within each folder (`index.html` and corresponding JavaScript files) to see how these animations are implemented.
